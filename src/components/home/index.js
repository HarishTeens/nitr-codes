                    <h3>Competitive Programming</h3><br />
                    Competitive programming is a brain game which takes place on the Internet or a local network in which programmers have to code according to the given constraints. Here programmers are referred as competitive coders. Many top notch companies like Google and Facebook host contests like Codejam and Hackercup respectively. Those who perform well in these contests are recognised by these companies and get offers to work with these tech giants.

                    <h3>CP vs Software Development</h3>
                    See, when we say competitive programming we are generally associating with the idea of solving coding problems in those programming websites like codechef, topcoder, spoj, etc. And when we talk about a developer we are picturing a person developing applications, building websites, developing backends, handling scalability issues, making mobile apps, etc. <br /><br />
                    A competitive programmer has a good hold on analytical thinking, problem solving skills, algorithms, data structures, time and space complexity of the code. But wouldnâ€™t a developer need these to actually develop a good software?<br /><br />
                    A competitive programmer can solve problems in a better way. They are good in using their analytical thinking skills which they have enhance by doing more and more competitive programming. They are good at knowing which data structures and algorithms are better suited for a particular program and they are good at solving hard problems.<br /><br />
                    A developer can build good software without having competitive programming skills but can only go so far. Without having good problem solving skills and good knowledge of data structures and algorithms, the developer will not be able to make his/her application/software faster, more efficient, having better time and space complexity.<br /><br />
                    So both of them need each other. So better to become both and help yourself. Its easier said than done. There is often some kind of a bias that you may see regarding this.<br /><br />
